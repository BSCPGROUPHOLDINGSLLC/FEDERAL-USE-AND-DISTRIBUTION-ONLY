Thank you for contacting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Office of Inspector General (OIG).  The OIG is an independent office within the SEC that primarily audits internal SEC operations and investigates alleged SEC staff misconduct.  The OIG derives its authority from the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended.  In accordance with that statute, the OIG cannot perform SEC operating responsibilities, such as investigation of alleged securities law violations.  Further, the OIG has no authority to affect or overturn Commission decisions regarding whistleblower awards.

 

If your complaint relates to alleged SEC employee misconduct, please provide specific information or evidence to the OIG as follows: 

(1) the identity of the employee(s) involved;

(2) the approximate date of the alleged misconduct;

(3) the specific nature of the alleged misconduct;

(4) the rules, regulations, or statutes that you allege the employee violated;

(5) the identity of other persons who might be aware of this alleged misconduct;

(6) the basis for your knowledge of the alleged misconduct;

(7) any documentary evidence of the alleged misconduct; and

(8) a statement regarding whether you (a) request confidentiality or (b) waive confidentiality (your name may be released to non-OIG personnel if an investigation is needed).

 

 

The OIG will evaluate your written complaint and determine an appropriate course of action.  Options include opening an OIG review (audit, evaluation or investigation); referring the matter to a SEC Division or Office for review and corrective action, if warranted; referring the matter to another Federal agency; or taking no action (allegations that do not involve a potential violation of law, rule, regulation, or policy as well as allegations with limited specificity or merit may be closed with no further action).  Due to privacy interests, we do not provide complainants with updates on, or the results of, complaints and/or investigative matters.

 

Please note that to request nonpublic information you must contact the SEC’s Office of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Services.  For general information and instructions on how to request specific types of information, please visit www.sec.gov/foia.shtml.  If you have any questions, you may contact that office directly at 202-551-7900 or foiapa@sec.gov. 

 

Respectfully,
